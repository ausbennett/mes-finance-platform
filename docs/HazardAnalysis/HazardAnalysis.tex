\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User Information Database:} A secured storage location for user data that may need to be repeatedly referenced, such as contact or bank information.
  \item \textbf{Backup Database:} A separate database, holding similar data to the User Information DB, but backed up regularly via the main database. Used in the event old data is needed or there is a problem with the main db.
  \item \textbf{User Interface:} An umbrella term for the graphical layout of the software system. All interactions between user and system will be facilitated through the UI, which provides a visual outline of system usage.
  \item \textbf{Payment/Funding Request Module:} A partition of the system into functions and interfaces supporting reimbursement, payment, and intramural funding requests. A liason between users making requests and users with the ability to approve or deny.
  \item \textbf{Invoice Generation Module:} A partition of the system supporting the generation and submission of personalized invoices.
  \item \textbf{Notification Module:} A partition of the system supporting automated notifications for users to track statuses of payment/reimbursement requests, etc via email.
  \item \textbf{Authentication Module:} A partition of the system supporting login and authentication of privileges and actions for users, such as making, approving, or denying requests.
  \item \textbf{Stripe API:} External API for streamlining future integration with other MES services or even third parties.
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}


\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

    \textbf{Adam:} For my section (FMEA tables) brainstorming the actual hazards/risks for the system went relatively well. There aren't any inherent "safety" risks that would endanger anyone's physical well-being, there really are only security risks that we have to worry about. Since we're dealing with financial information, these risks were quite obvious to identify and mitigate. Evidently, we need encryption, user authentication, etc. to ensure that we're upholding data privacy and financial information is stored securely.

    \textbf{Jacob:} For section 3, there were a couple of obvious partitions, specifically the databases. It's logical and commonplace to think of databases as separate from the other software components, so with that there were a couple easy partitions to make right out of the gate.
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

    \textbf{Adam:} One of the biggest pain points I had while writing my section was formatting the tables using latex. I had to import extra packages and spend a lot of time playing around with the spacing of things to ensure it was legible and formatted decently. Unfortunately, This took more time than the actual engineering work of coming up with the hazards. It would be nice if we could make the tables in a Word document and then insert a screenshot into the Latex file, but I can see how this would defeat the purpose of traceability.

    \textbf{Jacob:} For section 3, the difficulty came from how to partition the system. Since it is all software, there are no concrete components to separate. So, it was necessary to reason what logical partitions might be, and decide if a partition was too large or small to make sense.

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?

    \textbf{Jacob:} One big risk is data security. We will be handling sensitive personal information from users, so it is critical that this data stays well-secured and out of the hands of any unauthorized users to protect people's privacy and banking assets. Secondly, large system downtimes or failures is a huge risk. A long outage has the potential to seriously slow and cripple financial operations that may lead to funding and payment issues, or losing track of debts and payments.

    \textbf{Adam:} Another type of risk, and the one we will be mostly dealing with, is a security risk. More specifically, security risks to personal financial information/data. This also includes unauthorized access to user accounts, which could jeopardize data confidentiality and integrity. This is important to consider because this could lead to legal and financial repercussions. Financial data breaches and leaks can also lead to the organization losing its reputation. Another form of risk is operational risk. This relates to the stability and performance of the system. This is important to consider because operational performance can sometimes lead to other failures that lead to other risks, for example, the system fails a data backup, or a bug fails to encrypt data, and data is lost or exposed (security risk).
