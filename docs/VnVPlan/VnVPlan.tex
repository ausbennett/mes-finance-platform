\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

This document provides a structured Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for the McMaster Engineering Society (MES) financial platform project. The purpose of this V\&V plan is to outline a systematic approach to evaluate the platform's reliability, usability, and security. This document includes a summary of the software, objectives for testing, identified out-of-scope areas, and relevant references to the project's technical documents. Following this introduction, each section will elaborate on key elements necessary to achieve confidence in the platform's correctness and suitability for MES’s needs.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The MES financial platform is primarily a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application tailored to streamline accounting and intake responsibilities for MES. At its core, the software is responsible for managing and processing data related to reimbursement requests and integrates with external data sources for accounting functions. Key features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accounting Integration:} Seamless integration with external data sources for transaction records, making financial management more efficient.
    \item \textbf{Data Processing:} Handling and tracking reimbursement requests from initiation through completion.
    \item \textbf{User Management:} Supports various user roles within MES to facilitate secure access and control over financial data.
\end{itemize}

The platform is designed to serve as a centralized tool for managing MES financial tasks, reducing the manual load on accounting staff and ensuring reliable financial record-keeping.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this V\&V process are to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build Confidence in Software Correctness:} Verify that the software functions as intended for all primary use cases, reducing errors in financial and intake records.
    \item \textbf{Demonstrate Adequate Usability:} Ensure the platform is intuitive, easy to adopt, and efficiently serves MES's accounting and reimbursement needs with minimal user training.
    \item \textbf{Establish Data Security:} Validate that the platform secures sensitive financial data, instilling confidence among users regarding data safety and privacy.
    \item \textbf{Ensure Maintainability:} Confirm that the codebase and system are designed to be easily understood, extended, and maintained by future MES teams or other developers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Out-of-Scope Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} While the platform’s speed is important, performance tuning is considered a secondary priority for this V\&V plan, as it does not impact the primary functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Reliability and Robustness Testing:} Long-term reliability under heavy load is out of scope, given MES's anticipated user volume is low. Robustness, including extensive error handling for edge cases, is beyond the available resources.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The platform is intended for MES's internal use, so high scalability to support a large user base or high transaction volume is not prioritized.
    \item \textbf{Portability and Reusability:} Adaptation for other organizations or platforms is not included, as this project is specifically tailored for MES.
\end{itemize}

In this project, the team recognizes the constraints on time and resources. Thus, while striving to meet MES’s immediate requirements, this V\&V plan will also ensure the platform lays a robust foundation for potential future improvements.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

This project is classified as a general-level project. Given the critical role of user adoption and ease of use, the team has opted to include \textbf{user documentation} as an extra deliverable. This documentation will provide essential guidance to new users, helping to ease the learning curve and ensure sustained adoption of the platform by MES staff.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The following project documents will inform the V\&V process, providing necessary references for testing and validation efforts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS):} Details the specific functional and non-functional requirements for the platform, serving as the baseline for validation efforts.
    \item \textbf{Software Design Document (SD):} Provides a comprehensive view of the platform's architecture and design decisions. This will help verify that the implemented software aligns with the intended structure and workflow.
    \item \textbf{Module Guide (MG):} Describes the organization of the software into modules, assisting in modular testing and helping developers isolate and validate individual components.
    \item \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS):} Defines the interface requirements for each module, supporting integration testing to confirm seamless interaction between components.
\end{itemize}

These documents collectively support the V\&V process by specifying expected behaviors, design constraints, and modular structures, ensuring that the platform aligns with MES's goals.

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

  \textbf{Christian:} There was a high degree of certainty with this document that made the final product come out well. Knowing that there must be tests for all requirements and that plans must be made to verify and validate all aspects of the project thus far as well as future elements, there is almost no ambiguity in what should be included, only with making sure everything relevant is included, as, to an extent, you can never be too sure when validating.
  \textbf{Austin:} The availability of resources to facilitate the creation of this document.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

  \textbf{Christian:} The biggest pain point was simply making sure that all relevant information was present in the document. With so much to potentially validate and verify, it becomes a worry that you're not being rigorous enough, or you haven't anticipated enough. To mitigate this we engaged in group brainstorming as well as constantly supporting each other remotely. Another fact that helped was knowing that many of the specifics for this document are not imminently necessary to nail down.
  \textbf{Austin:} Trying to forecast what documents the VnV will use that have not been made yet

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

  \textbf{Austin:} One knowledge I need to aquire is a better traceability of design requirements and decisisons into their respective documentation, to ensure nothing has been overlooked.
  \textbf{Christian:} Personally, I will need to develop my knowledge of existing testing tools. I have a fair understanding of testing methods and what methods apply when, however I admittedly have little experience with actual testing tools, and should familiarize myself with any potential tools that can be useful for us going forward, whether it be for static or dynamic testing.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \textbf{Christian:} One approach to mastering verification ot validation tools would be to simply read up on many different kinds and learn their strengths or weaknesses. While many testing platforms may explicitly offer the functionality we're looking for, some are lkely to be more geared to our application than othes. Another approach could be to find the most popular platform and get familiar with that one specifically, as a way to better prepare myself not only for this project but also what may be expected of me in industry for similar types of projects. Personally, I do prefer the first option however because I value versatility in my development abilities and would rather not be pidgeonholed into a specific niche too early.
  \textbf{Austin:} Perhaps some visualization technique, to see the "flow" of requirements or design decisions reflected in a checklist
