\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

The following sections will cover system tests for functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the \href{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Tests for Functional Requirements 9.1.1 - Reimbursement and Payment Request Feature}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

The subsections below cover tests relating to functional requirements for the reimbursement request feature. The tests below cover requirements FR1.1 - FR1.9 in section 9.1.1 of the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}.

\paragraph{FR1.6 - Data Storage and Categorization Tests}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{FR1.6-TC1}}
    
    Control: Manual
    
    Initial State:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A user is authenticated and logged into the system
        \item User has navigated to the "Submit Reimbursement Request" page
    \end{itemize}
    
    Inputs: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User selects "Office Supplies" as budget category from predefined list
        \item User submits the request
    \end{itemize}
    
    Output: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Request information is stored in the DB
        \item Request object is given budget category attribute "Office supplies"
    \end{itemize}
    
    Test Case Derivation: This test verifies that the system will store and categorize reimbursement requests based on budget categories for ledger tracking as per FR1.6 in the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}.
    
    How test will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Logged in as a user, submit a reimbursement request with the budget category "Office Supplies"
        \item Verify using Postman that the correct budget category was assigned to the request and reflected in the DB
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{FR1.7 - Access Control Tests}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{FR1.7-TC1}}

        \item User X attempts to access User Y's request details
    \end{itemize}
    
    Output: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system denies access and displays an error message - "You do not have access"
    \end{itemize}
    
    Test Case Derivation: This verifies that the system can restrict access to view sensitive financial information submitted by users as per FR1.7 in the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}. General users should only have access to view requests that they have submitted.
    
    How test will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Log in as User Y and navigate to "My Requests", and copy the URL.
        \item Log in as User X and attempt to access the URL/page of User Y's requests page
        \item Verify that access is denied and an error message is returned
        \item Verify that User X can view their own requests
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{FR1.7-TC2}}
    
    Control: Manual
    
    Initial State:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User X and User Y have submitted reimbursement requests.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Inputs: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Admin navigate to "Pending Requests"
    \end{itemize}
    
    Output: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system responds with all submitted reimbursement requests. Admin can view User X's requests and User Y's requests
    \end{itemize}
    
    Test Case Derivation: This verifies that the system can restrict access to view sensitive financial information submitted by users as per FR1.7 in the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}. Admin users should have access to view all submitted requests.
    
    How test will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Log in as Admin and navigate to "Pending Requests" page
        \item Verify that all requests displayed in the UI match all requests stored in the DB
        \item Verify that User X's and User Y's requests can be selected, and viewed, and actions can be performed on them
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{FR1.8 - Admin Collaboration Tests}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{FR1.8-TC1}}
    
    Control: Manual

    \end{itemize}
    
    Inputs: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both Admins access the same request
        \item Admin 1 changes the status of the request to "Approved"
        \item Admin 2 changes the status of the request to "Rejected"
    \end{itemize}
    
    Output: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system flags the request and sets its status to "Needs Review"
        \item The system tracks both actions in the audit log
        \item The system adds a note associated with the requests - "Mismatched status update, please review and update" 
        \item The system does not notify the user of this status change
    \end{itemize}
    
    Test Case Derivation: This test case ensures that multiple admins can collaborate and review submitted requests as per FR1.8 in the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}. If two different admins set a request's status to conflicting values, that request must be reviewed and a singular status value must be selected.
    
    How test will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Log in as Admin 1 and Admin 2, access the same request, and make the respective status changes
        \item Verify the system changes the request status to "Needs Review" in the UI and in the DB
        \item Verify the system generated an associated 'note' field for the request that reads "Mismatched status update, please review and update." This field should be visible in the UI and stored in the DB
        \item Verify the system did not send an update notification to the user by either accessing the user's inbox or using Postman to check that no API call was made
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}
    
    Inputs: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An admin changes the status of the request from "Submitted" to "Approved"
    \end{itemize}
    
    Output: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system records the action with details: request ID, action type (status change), user (name, email), timestamp
    \end{itemize}
    
    Test Case Derivation: This test verifies that the system can track and store all actions performed concerning a single reimbursement request as per FR1.9 in the \href{https://shorturl.at/FdAgR}{SRS}. 
    
    How test will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As a user, submit a request
        \item As an admin, change the status of the request to "Approved"
        \item Verify that the system stored the correct action details under the correct table in the DB.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tests for Functional Requirements 9.1.2 - Custom Invoice Generation Feature}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

  \textbf{Christian:} There was a high degree of certainty with this document that made the final product come out well. Knowing that there must be tests for all requirements and that plans must be made to verify and validate all aspects of the project thus far as well as future elements, there is almost no ambiguity in what should be included, only with making sure everything relevant is included, as, to an extent, you can never be too sure when validating.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

  \textbf{Christian:} The biggest pain point was simply making sure that all relevant information was present in the document. With so much to potentially validate and verify, it becomes a worry that you're not being rigorous enough, or you haven't anticipated enough. To mitigate this we engaged in group brainstorming as well as constantly supporting each other remotely. Another fact that helped was knowing that many of the specifics for this document are not imminently necessary to nail down.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

  \textbf{Christian:} Personally, I will need to develop my knowledge of existing testing tools. I have a fair understanding of testing methods and what methods apply when, however I admittedly have little experience with actual testing tools, and should familiarize myself with any potential tools that can be useful for us going forward, whether it be for static or dynamic testing.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \textbf{Christian:} One approach to mastering verification ot validation tools would be to simply read up on many different kinds and learn their strengths or weaknesses. While many testing platforms may explicitly offer the functionality we're looking for, some are lkely to be more geared to our application than othes. Another approach could be to find the most popular platform and get familiar with that one specifically, as a way to better prepare myself not only for this project but also what may be expected of me in industry for similar types of projects. Personally, I do prefer the first option however because I value versatility in my development abilities and would rather not be pidgeonholed into a specific niche too early.
