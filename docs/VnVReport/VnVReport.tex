\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}

The functional requirements can be referenced from the \href{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}. The modules can be referenced below and from the \href{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item M1: Hardware-Hiding Module
    \item M2: Account Management Module
    \item M3: Requests Module
    \item M4: Notification Module
    \item M5: User Dashboard Module
    \item M6: Authentication Module
    \item M7: Email Module
    \item M8: Account Management Controller Module
    \item M9: Requests Controller Module
    \item M10: Clubs Database
    \item M11: Users Database
    \item M12: Requests Database
    \item M13: Graphical User Interface
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:FReval} summarizes the functional requirements checklist for each functional requirement from the SRS, linking to each module from the MG and test case from the \href{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}. If a functional requirement was determined to be satisfied or not staisfied by the tests with a "*" flag, then more explanation is given below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item FR1.3: UI components and pages are implemented to allow users and admins to edit submitted requests, however, work must now be done to connect backend to frontend UI to allow for changes to be reflected in the database.
    \item FR1.5: The system does not currently notify users of changes to the status of their reimbursement request, however, the email notification service/module is set up and can be executed in an isolated environment. Work must now be done ensure the email service can dynamically email users with updates for their submitted requests.
    \item FR1.6: UI is implemented to allow users to select a budget category. Budget categories need to be dynamically pulled from a database collection. Work must be done to connect backend service (Plaid API) to frontend UI to allow budget categories to be linked to requests and reflected in the database.
    \item FR1.7: Due to the fact that authentication is not completely implemented, this requirement cannot be satisfied. We do have page routing and UI implemented to distinguish admin page views and user page views.
    \item FR3.2: Authentication is not fully set up. Currently, we are manually setting user browser tokens when creating a user and logging in, work must be done to either dynamically assign user browser token, or adjust the authentication process to user vanilla username (email) and password for the login process.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compliance (NFR17)}  
\label{nfr17}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Legal (Test T1):}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Unit Testing}

Most files, excluding the 3rd-party library, top-level and GUI modules had corresponding unit tests.
All tests were performed using jest for testing javascript, and each commit to the main branch must pass all the tests.
All the tests passed as seen in the Test Report \ref{test_report}.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section{Automated Testing}

The tests were set up to automatically run in GitHub Actions whenever a commit was pushed to the $\mathtt{main}$ branch.
The configuration for the CI/CD automation can be found at \url{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml}
and the test pipeline can be viewed at \url{https://github.com/ausbennett/mes-finance-platform/actions/workflows/test.yml}.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\
\\
In this deliverable, leveraging tools like GitHub Actions for automated testing helped us streamline validation. Additionally, having already incorporated feedback from the V\&V Plan, it made the process of creating the V\&V Report much easier. From delegating roles to having pre-made checklists for usability testing, using the V\&V Plan made our lives much easier.\\

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?\\
\\
A significant challenge was designing a test suite that remains relevant as the project evolves. Since some core features are still in development, early tests risked becoming obsolete as APIs and interfaces changed. To address this, we prioritized testing isolated modules (e.g., database schemas, utility functions) with stable contracts and used mocking for incomplete subsystems. We also adopted a CI/CD-driven iterative approach, updating tests incrementally alongside implementation sprints to ensure alignment while preserving test value.\\

  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?\\
\\
The usability testing checklist was shaped by stakeholders as our supervisor has been vocal about which features should have a bigger focus on usability rather than expanding the functionality. Other things, such as our automated testing strategy, were internally designed. From the testing we did before the Rev0 demo, we are already aware of which areas require more rigorous testing compared to other features.\\
  
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)\\
\\The main difference between the plan and the report was the scale of the testing. The plan was more ambitious than what was probably doable in the time frame, and we had pages and pages of tests for NFRs that would have required external stakeholders to execute, some of whom may be hard to get a hold of. As we moved forward it became clear we needed to focus our energy toward a smaller suite that makes more use of automated testing and usability testing with Luke to cover our bases. It is definitely possible in future projects to foresee this kind of an issue. However, timing can be a difficult thing to predict and one often doesn't know how things will pan out until they actually happen.
