This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the final
demonstration and documentation.  The time period of interest is the time
between Rev 0 and the Final documentation (Feb 11 - Mar 26). It will be updated closer to the final presentation date to more accurately reflect the contribution numbers. 

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}
